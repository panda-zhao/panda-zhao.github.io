When injected into the exhaust, it can convert nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen and water. Reduction The agent pump assembly contains a pressure pump, a pressure sensor, a purge valve, an outlet filter and an internal heating element. The role of the reductant pressure sensor is to control the pump speed for the PCM through pulse width modulation (PCM), thereby regulating the system pressure to provide Feedback. When the PCM requests reductant injection, the reductant injector opens and the pump runs, providing pressure to the original pressure line and injectors and purging air from the system. When all air has been purged, fuel is injected The pump shuts off and the pump provides a pressure of about 500kPa in preparation for the reductant injection."
