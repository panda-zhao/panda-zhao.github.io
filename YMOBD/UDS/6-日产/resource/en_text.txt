Expected engine speed may reach between 1000 to 1500 RPM. Please read carefully and follow these instructions to avoid the risk of fire, property damage, burns or other serious personal injury.\\n\\nTo prepare for a stationary regeneration:\\n1.

Park the truck securely\\n- Set the parking brake\\n- Place transmission in 'Park' if provided, otherwise in 'Neutral'\\n- Set wheel chocks at front and rear of at least one tire \\n3. Set up a safe exhaust area\\n- If bystanders might enter the area, set up barriers to keep people at least 5 feet from the exhaust outlet during regeneration \\n- When indoors, attach an exhaust discharge pipe rated for at least 800 C (1472 F)\\n- Keep a fire extinguisher nearby\\n4.  Check exhaust system surfaces\\n- Confirm that nothing is on or near the exhaust system surfaces (such as tools, rags, grease, debris)\\n5.  Prepare for engine speed changes during regeneration\\n- Do not operate any PTO powered devices. These devices must be disconnected  before starting the regeneration \\n- Stay clear of the engine compartment\\n\\nEnsure that the vehicle and surrounding area are monitored during regeneration.
