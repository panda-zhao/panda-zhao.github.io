The second sensor, the Heated Oxygen (HO2) sensor, sends post-catalyst information to the ECM.\\nIn order to detect any deterioration in the TWC, the ECM calculates the Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC) of the TWC. This calculation is based on the voltage output of the HO2 sensor while performing active air-fuel ratio control, rather than the conventional detecting method, which uses the locus ratio.\\nThe OSC value is an indication of the oxygen storage capacity of the TWC. When the vehicle is being driven with a warm engine, active air-fuel ratio control is performed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds. When it is performed, the ECM deliberately sets the air-fuel ratio to lean or rich levels. If a rich-lean cycle of the HO2 sensor is long, the OSC becomes greater. There is a direct correlation between the OSCs of the HO2 sensor and the TWC.\\nThe ECM uses the OSC value to determine the state of the TWC.
