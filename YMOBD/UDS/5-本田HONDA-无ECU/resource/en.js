The right hand side contains the main controls. This is divided into 5 areas. From the top these are: 1. The channel selection panel. Selects the active channel (the channel that the cursor controls act upon). Auto configure sets up the display for the active channel to best display the input signal. A channel can also be set active by touching it in the display area. 2. The X-Axis control - Press the button to change the X scaling and the visibility of the active trace. Also allows you to invert the input signal. 3. The Y-Axis control - Press the button to change the Y scaling and the zoom (magnification) factor. You can also zoom in and out using the zoom buttons on the right hand control bar. 4. The Cursor control - Press one of the left hand buttons to select the function of the cursor cluster. The top two buttons select Cursor A or B,which allow you to make measurements directly on the display. Values are displayed in the status area. The bottom left button sets the cursor keys to move the active trace. The bottom right button sets the cursor keys to move the trigger cursor. The button in the centre of the cursor cluster resets the current cursor function. 5. The Status area - Results of calculations (see Calculation Page) and cursor measurements are displayed here. The control bar on the right hand side can display various buttons. From the top these are: 1. Main Menu - Save and load configurations,and work with offline data. 2. Pause - Stop and start the data acquisition process. 3. Information - displays this information. 4. Zoom In - increases the magnification factor of the data display. 5. Zoom Out - decreases the magnification factor of the data display. 6. Full Screen - Expands the data display to allow more trace data to be displayed.",
